# Python Tutorial 
**Abstraction:** hiding complex code and showing important steps of an object. It hides implementation details and only shows 
operations related to objects. The payment implements the abstract method Payment(). As a user we are able to see that 
since the object CreditCardPayment was created and the Payment method cannot be seen. 
**Inheritance:** There is a hierarchy, meaning there is a parent and child class. The child class derives information
from the parent class. In the example code that we have Account class takes in information such as withdrawing and 
depositing money. Another class called PrivilegedAccount does the same but also schedules appointments. This allows 
PrivilegedAccount to inherit data from Account class.
